    <h2>Description</h2>
     
        <p>This chocolate cake uses butter for flavor and a bit of oil for a never-fail moist crumb, 
        ideal for celebrations. With more of a milk chocolate, 
        rather than dark chocolate flavor, it's perfect for kids.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>2 1/4 cups  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour </li>
            
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa, Dutch-process or natural</li>
            <li>8 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li> large eggs</li>

        </ul>

     <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
           
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease and flour your choice of pans: 
                one 9" x 13" pan, two 9" round pans, or three 8" round pans. </li>
            
            <li>Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cocoa, 
                and sugar into a large mixing bowl.</li>

            <li>Add the butter and mix at low speed for 1 minute. With the mixer running, 
                add the oil and continue mixing until the mixture looks sandy, about 30 seconds more.</li>

            <li>In a large measuring cup, combine the vanilla with the milk and coffee(or water), and add all at once to the dry ingredients. 
                Mix for 1 minute at low speed, stop and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, 
                then mix for 30 seconds more.</li>


        </ol>
